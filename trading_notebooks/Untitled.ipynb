    "- __The Law of Supply and Demand__ : When demand is greater than supply, then prices will rise to meet this demand, and conversely when supply is greater then demand then prices will fall, with the over supply being absorbed as a result.\n",
    "- __The Law of Cause and Effect__ : The effect will be in direct proportion to the cause. In other words, a small amount of volume activity will only result in a small amount of price action. \n",
    "- __The Law of Effort vs Result__ : The price action on the chart must reflect the volume action below. The two should always be in harmony with one another, with the effort ( which is the volume ) seen as the result (which is the consequent price action).\n",

    "- __Principle No 2 : Patience__ The moral here is not to act immediately as soon as a signal appears. Any signal is merely a warning sign of an impending change and we do have to be patient.\n",
    "- __Principle No 3 : It’s All Relative__ Volume is all relative, so it makes no difference as long as you are using the same feed all the time.\n",
